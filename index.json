    "summary": "Hi there This blog is about my journey to Aerospace Engineering. The plan looks like the following: re-do the high school final exam in physics and mathematics to ensure that I have good enough grades to get accepted to TU Delft MSc Aerospace Engineering degree specialized to GNC, TU Delft MSc Applied Mathematics TU Delft getting a job at SpaceX and going hardcore in Mars exploration and asteroid mining"

    "summary": "Study strategy This is about using my previous experiences and existing knowledge to accelerate my studies. I need to see the context. During the 2 MA, an unfinished MBA, English Advanced Level I understood that I need to see a context of how the thing I study is used. One might say, this is the practicality of the knowledge. I would not bind my need only for practicality. The context for me means \"how it is used now\" (which is practicality) and imagine that \"how I am going to use it\", which is rather an imagination. If I don't have these, the stuff doesn't stick. Imagination is the biggest container in how my mind works. I can serve this need by an activity I call \"discovery\". This is when I read introduction and advanced level books in a certain topic. This makes the context and the language used by the field familiar to me. Across many books I can discover the big chunks of the field. Focus on understanding than pushing the knowledge into my mind I need to reach a level when I can draw a mind map or a thesaurus (information retrieval thesaurus - a librarian thing) about a topic or a field. This thesaurus doesn't require me to have memorised knowledge from the field. It requires me to explore it and distill some knowledge from the exploration. There are occasions when a topic is so interesting for me I go deep by default because I want to satisfy my curiosity. This is normal and I have to let it happen. These deep dives provide tremendous energy to continue the learning and pick up the boring, not interesting part at all. The importance (learn it now or learn it later) of corner cases will be decided case-by-case basis. First, if you postpone it for long time it will bite you. But, you can postpone it for short period of time to avoid rabbit-holes and rather keeping up the flow. Practice and deliberate practice The two levels are close to each other. Practice means I start using the knowledge and build up procedures how to use it. Deliberate practice is doing the same in high volume. Flashcards and hammering Flashcards are needed to keep the knowledge fresh over time. The hammering is repeat and repeat everything. Big picture Time after time the connection between fields need to be looked at. There are connections between fields I have to be aware of and dealing with them. Moreover, there are implicit connections and I need to discover these."

    "summary": "Map of Mathematics When I study I build a map like this in my mind and as I my knowledge develops the map gets more and more detailed. Deal with it... How to use this map? This map tries to show how things are coming together in calculus, in final form it will be Applied Mathematics. I had issues to see the connections between the details and this graph shows my understanding of things in Calculus especially how things are connected. The other aspect of connections are the rigour in mathematics: everything has to be proven. I have some interest in understanding these proofs and which one is pre-requisite to which detail and why. As a consequence these details are shown. The subsequent pages are going to discuss every single detail. The method you see here is an information retrieval thesaurus.
