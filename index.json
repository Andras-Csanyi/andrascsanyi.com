    "summary": "Hi there This blog is about my journey to Aerospace Engineering. The plan looks like the following: re-do the high school final exam in physics and mathematics to ensure that I have good enough grades to get accepted to TU Delft MSc Aerospace Engineering degree specialized to GNC, TU Delft MSc Applied Mathematics TU Delft getting a job at SpaceX and going hardcore in Mars exploration and asteroid mining"

    "summary": "Study strategy This is about using my previous experiences and existing knowledge to accelerate my studies. I need to see the context. During the 2 MA, an unfinished MBA, English Advanced Level I understood that I need to see a context of how the thing I study is used. One might say, this is the practicality of the knowledge. I would not bind my need only for practicality. The context for me means \"how it is used now\" (which is practicality) and imagine that \"how I am going to use it\", which is rather an imagination. If I don't have these, the stuff doesn't stick. Imagination is the biggest container in how my mind works. I can serve this need by an activity I call \"discovery\". This is when I read introduction and advanced level books in a certain topic. This makes the context and the language used by the field familiar to me. Across many books I can discover the big chunks of the field. Focus on understanding than pushing the knowledge into my mind I need to reach a level when I can draw a mind map or a thesaurus (information retrieval thesaurus - a librarian thing) about a topic or a field. This thesaurus doesn't require me to have memorised knowledge from the field. It requires me to explore it and distill some knowledge from the exploration. There are occasions when a topic is so interesting for me I go deep by default because I want to satisfy my curiosity. This is normal and I have to let it happen. These deep dives provide tremendous energy to continue the learning and pick up the boring, not interesting part at all. The importance (learn it now or learn it later) of corner cases will be decided case-by-case basis. First, if you postpone it for long time it will bite you. But, you can postpone it for short period of time to avoid rabbit-holes and rather keeping up the flow. Practice and deliberate practice The two levels are close to each other. Practice means I start using the knowledge and build up procedures how to use it. Deliberate practice is doing the same in high volume. Flashcards and hammering Flashcards are needed to keep the knowledge fresh over time. The hammering is repeat and repeat everything. Big picture Time after time the connection between fields need to be looked at. There are connections between fields I have to be aware of and dealing with them. Moreover, there are implicit connections and I need to discover these."

    "summary": "Functions Function describes a situation when one quantity depends on another. A good example is the circle (\\(A=\\pi \\cdot r^2\\)) where \\(A\\) depends on the radius, \\(r\\), of the circle. The area of the circle in function form is: \\(A=f(r)\\) Definitions DEFINITION The Function A function \\(f\\) is a rule that assigns to each element \\(x\\) in a set \\(D\\) exactly one element, called \\(f(x)\\), in a set \\(E\\). Sets \\(E\\) and \\(D\\) are sets of real numbers. Domain: in the above definition the set \\(D\\) is the domain of the function. The number \\(f(x)\\) is the value of \\(f\\) at x and it is read \"\\(f\\) of \\(x\\)\". Range: in the above definition \\(E\\) is the range which represents all possible values of \\(f(x)\\) as \\(x\\) varies throughut the domain. Independent variable: the symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the \\(domain\\) of function \\(f\\) is called independent variable. In the circle example the independent variable is \\(r\\). Dependent variable: The symbol that represents a number in the \\(range\\) of \\(f\\). In the circle example the dependent variable is \\(A\\). Representation of functions verbally numerically visually algebraically The Vertical Line Test To test whether the equation is a function, meaning exactly one element of the domain is assigned to exactly one element of the range, we have The Vertical Line Test. DEFINITION The Vertical Line Test A curve in the \\(xy\\)-plane is the graph of a function of \\(x\\) if and only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once. Properties of functions Piecewise defined functions There are cases when a function have different formulas in different part of their domain. These are the piecewise defined functions. \\[ f(x) = \\begin{cases} x^2 & \\text{if } x < 0 \\\\ 0 & \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\ x + 1 & \\text{if } x > 0 \\end{cases} \\] Even or odd functions If function \\(f\\) satisfies \\[ f(-x) = f(x) \\] for every number in its domain, then \\(f\\) is an even function. It also means that the graph is symmetric to the \\(y\\)-axis. If function \\(f\\) satisfies \\[ f(-x) = -f(x) \\] for every number in its domain, then \\(f\\) is an odd function. It also means that the graph is about the origin. Increasing and Decreasing functions DEFINITION Increasing and Decreasing functions A function is called increasing on interval \\(I\\) if \\[ f(x_1)<f(x_2) \\text{ whenever } x_1 < x_2 \\text{ in } I \\] A function is called decreasing on interval \\(I\\) if \\[ f(x_1)>f(x_2) \\text{ whenever } x_1 < x_2 \\text{ in } I \\]"

This map tries to show how things are coming together in calculus, in final form it will be Applied Mathematics. I had issues to see the connections between the details and this graph shows my understanding of things in Calculus especially how things are connected. The other aspect of connections are the rigour in mathematics: everything has to be proven. I have some interest in understanding these proofs and which one is pre-requisite to which detail and why. As a consequence these details are shown. The subsequent pages are going to discuss every single detail. The method you see here is an information retrieval thesaurus.

    "summary": "Real numbers Natural numbers Positive numbers like \\(1, 2, 3, 4,...\\). Integers Can be both positive and negative like \\(-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\\). Rational numbers Rational numbers are constructed by taking ratios of integers as below. \\[ r = \\frac{m}{n} \\] where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are integers and \\(n \\neq 0\\). Properties of real numbers Commutative properties \\(a + b = b + a\\), meaning when two numbers are added, the order doesn't matter. \\(a \\cdot b = b \\cdot a\\), meaning when two numbers are multiplied, the order doesn't matter.
