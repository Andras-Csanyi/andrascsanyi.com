    "summary": "Map of Mathematics When I study I build a map like this in my mind and as I my knowledge develops the map gets more and more detailed. Deal with it... How to use this map? This map tries to show how things are coming together in calculus, in final form it will be Applied Mathematics. I had issues to see the connections between the details and this graph shows my understanding of things in Calculus especially how things are connected. The other aspect of connections are the rigour in mathematics: everything has to be proven. I have some interest in understanding these proofs and which one is pre-requisite to which detail and why. As a consequence these details are shown. The subsequent pages are going to discuss every single detail. The method you see here is an information retrieval thesaurus.
