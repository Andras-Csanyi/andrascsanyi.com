My original plan was to build a site with awesome aerospace engineering content.
But, aerospace engineering is 90% mathematics. And if mathematics, then it is $
\LaTeX $. It turned out that all the fairly easy to use static site generators
use the same solution to display $ \LaTeX $ content: mathjx. I don't like that
it doesn't support $ \LaTeX $ fully. So, I ditched the idea.

My plans include doing an MSc degree in applied mathematics which means mastery
in $ \LaTeX $ and not in "how to display nice $ \LaTeX $ like content with md
hacks". So, I started rather a $ \LaTeX $ book and writing that book will
enhance my $ \LaTeX $ skills. I can say that I am ok in $ \LaTeX $ topic since
my previous two Master theses were created in $ \LaTeX $.

Anyway, you'll find the book under the header link.
