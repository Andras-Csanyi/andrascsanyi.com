Recently I started working on a programming language, called [PotatoLang](https://github.com/PotatoLang), and you may ask "why?".

![But why?](images/but_why.gif)

Because it sucks.

Sucks mean effort, the necessity of thinking and that your brain has to work.
Your knowledge has to be exercised and extended, changed in many and new ways to solve problems.
Brain, in this aspect, no different than muscles.
They have to be exercised to keep up their strength, flexibility and versatility.
If you don't do it, you'll loose the skill.

I want my skills better and stronger than they were before.
On **"The Grand Scheme of Things"** level everything is about [Mechanical Sympathy](https://x.com/i/grok/share/IJeebecRQMSIR9UOuxyQ3hmoT).

You may ask **"why bother with this"** in the world where LLMs will solve this problem?

Because LLMs won't do that.
They might evolve further and can do things in the future.
But, we cannot see when and in what form that will happen.
Sitting and waiting for the miracle to happen is not beneficial to anyone.
A human with strong technical knowledge is needed today and will be valuable in the future.

Try to answer the following question:
"Why LLM companies don't create the products instead of selling you the tool for a monthly subscription?
If their tool is soo good, why they don't create products with it?"

The personal aspect is that I just feel better as human being knowing these things.
It feels just better.
