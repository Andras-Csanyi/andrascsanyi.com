title: Implementation of a dynamic size array - part 1
description: This is a journey of implementing a dynamically sized array
---

In order to learn more and understanding data structures and algorithms better I decided to go
through them and create an implementation from all of them.
This is how I learn.

The journey also includes providing the theory and the practice parts.
The book section already have a few good drafts.

The first one is the [dynamically sized array](/software_engineering_book/dsa/dynamic_size_array/theory.html).
