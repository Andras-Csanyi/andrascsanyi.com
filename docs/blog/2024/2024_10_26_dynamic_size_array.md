title: Implementation of a dynamic size array - part 1
description: This is a journey of implementing a dynamically sized array

In order to learn more and understanding data structures and algorithms better I decided to go
through them and create an implementation from all of them.
This is how you learn.

The journey also includes providing a description for all of them.
The book section already have a few good drafts.
