# Study strategy

This is about using my previous experiences and existing knowledge to accelerate
my studies.

**I need to see the context.**
During the 2 MA, an unfinished MBA, English Advanced Level I understood that I
need to see a context of how the thing I study is used. One might say, this is
the practicality of the knowledge. I would not bind my need only for
practicality. The context for me means "how it is used now" (which is
practicality) and imagine that "how I am going to use it", which is rather an
imagination. If I don't have these, the stuff doesn't stick. Imagination is the
biggest container in how my mind works.

I can serve this need by an activity I call "discovery". This is when I read
introduction and advanced level books in a certain topic. This makes the
context and the language used by the field familiar to me. Across many books I
can discover the big chunks of the field.

**Focus on understanding than pushing the knowledge into my mind**
I need to reach a level when I can draw a mind map or a [thesaurus](/mathematics/map.html)
(information
retrieval thesaurus - a librarian thing) about a topic or a field. This
thesaurus doesn't require me to have memorised knowledge from the field. It
requires me to explore it and distill some knowledge from the exploration.

There are occasions when a topic is so interesting for me I go deep by default
because I want to satisfy my curiosity. This is normal and I have to let it
happen. These deep dives provide tremendous energy to continue the learning and
pick up the boring, not interesting part at all.

The importance (learn it now or learn it later) of corner cases will be decided
case-by-case basis. First, if you postpone it for long time it will bite you.
But, you can postpone it for short period of time to avoid rabbit-holes and
rather keeping up the flow.

**Practice and deliberate practice**
The two levels are close to each other. Practice means I start using the
knowledge and build up procedures how to use it. Deliberate practice is doing
the same in high volume.

**Flashcards and hammering**
Flashcards are needed to keep the knowledge fresh over time.

The hammering is repeat and repeat everything.

**Big picture**
Time after time the connection between fields need to be looked at. There are
connections between fields I have to be aware of and dealing with them.
Moreover, there are implicit connections and I need to discover these.
