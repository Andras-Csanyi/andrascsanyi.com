# Hi there

This blog is about my journey to Aerospace Engineering.

The plan looks like the following:

- re-do the high school final exam in physics and mathematics to ensure that I
  have good enough grades to get accepted to TU Delft
- MSc Aerospace Engineering degree specialized to GNC, TU Delft
- MSc Applied Mathematics TU Delft
- getting a job at SpaceX and going hardcore in Mars exploration and asteroid
  mining
