Software engineering is complex and difficult.
There are things one must know, has to understand, familiar with and just being aware of it.
The success is based on knowing these and some human skills.
This, so called, book covers what is needed to my career which is a backend developer
in microservice environment with sometimes little and sometimes significant technical debt or
legacy systems.
