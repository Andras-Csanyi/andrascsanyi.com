This book is about software engineering.
Every aspect of it.

Out of blue there is this book, collection of topics, experience and some opinions and you
might ask "who the hell is this guy?".

My name is Andras Csanyi and I have been working in software industry since 2005.
Long story short, during these years I had 3 different positions and now I'm in the 4th one.

I started my career as a customer service guy at Ritek Zrt., which is providing software
solutions for Szeged.
We had ~200 heavy users, mainly accountants, who used the system 6-10 hours per day.
I was the single person for almost 2 years who picked up the phone and helped them either 
solve their problem or record what bugs they reported.
It was an intense experience, but I collected pretty strong insights about what is important
for a user.
But, after 3 years I burned out and I quit.

I joined Astron Zrt. as manual tester.
The customer service job was half testing basically, so it seemed logical to do testing.
The testing I did at Astron was rather a mix of end-to-end and acceptance testing.
It was a really interesting experience to prepare all the documentation and test scenarios
for final testing and so on.
After 3 years I left the company and joined Epam.

In the Epam years I started working on automated functional tests with Selenium.
That time Selenium 1 still went strong and AJAX calls became common, and Selenium 1 could not
really manage it. Good times...
During these years I worked mainly with C# and Specflow.
During the Epam years I became senior test engineer.

A few years later I joined Dealogic as a senior tester.
Dealogic were in constant moving and they tried to figure out how they can deliver software.
When I joined test automation was already a topic, but not started.
I have found my ways to work with people and test automation slowly started.
And overnight I became a manager and started working on introducing test automation across
4-6 teams.
After a year or so I wanted to move to development manager position.
I wanted to be responsible for delivering software.
It took a while, but I became one.
18 months later I left the company.

I joined Cloudera as Engineering Manager who is responsible for upgrade testing.
That time CDH 6.0 was about to be released and some level of quality assurance was needed
to ensure that customers can move to the new version without or with little risk.

After the Cloudera-Hortonworks merger I became the manager one of the teams testing 
non-functionally the new CDP product.
It was an interesting thing, but me and the new company culture was incompatible.

After a short break I joined IBM as engineering manager and worked with two teams for a few 
months.
A decision to be a developer have been brewing in me for a while that time and I felt that
the world at IBM might be a good place for me to make the change.
I did it.
I started working with the Cloud SDK team and we released the Client SDKs for the IBM Cloud.
I really enjoyed working with those guys.
But, Booking.com found me.

I moved to Amsterdam and started working at Booking.com as Engineering Manager.
A year later I made the switch again back to software engineer role and been doing it since.
