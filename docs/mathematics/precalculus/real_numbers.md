# Real numbers

## Natural numbers

Positive numbers like $1, 2, 3, 4,...$.

## Integers

Can be both positive and negative like $-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3$.

## Rational numbers

Rational numbers are constructed by taking ratios of integers as below.

$$
r = \frac{m}{n}
$$

where $m$ and $n$ are integers and $n \neq 0$.

## Properties of real numbers

**Commutative properties**

$a + b = b + a$, meaning when two numbers are added, the order doesn't matter.

$a \cdot b = b \cdot a$, meaning when two numbers are multiplied, the order
doesn't matter.

**Associative properties**

$(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$, meaning when three numbers are added it doesn't
matter which two are added first.

$(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$, meaning when three numbers are
multiplied doesn't matter which two is multiplied first.

**Distributive property**

$$
a \cdot (b + c) = a \cdot b + a \cdot c \\
\qquad \\
(b + c) \cdot a = a \cdot b + a \cdot c
$$

meaning when a number is multiplied by a sum of two numbers, the result will be
the same when we start the adding the numbers and multiplying, or multiply both
first and adding them.
