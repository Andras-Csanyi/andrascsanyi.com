# Functions

Function describes a situation when one quantity depends on another.

A good example is the circle ($A=\pi \cdot r^2$) where $A$ depends on the
radius, $r$, of the circle.
The area of the circle in function form is: $A=f(r)$

## Definitions

> [!DEFINITION]
>
> **The Function**
>
> A function $f$ is a rule that assigns to each element $x$ in a set $D$ exactly one
> element, called $f(x)$, in a set $E$.
> Sets $E$ and $D$ are sets of real numbers.

- **Domain**: in the above definition the set $D$ is the domain of the function.
  The number $f(x)$ is the value of $f$ at x and it is read "$f$ of $x$".
- **Range**: in the above definition $E$ is the range which represents all
  possible values of $f(x)$ as $x$ varies throughut the domain.
- **Independent variable**: the symbol that represents an arbitrary number in
  the $domain$ of function $f$ is called independent variable. In the circle example
  the independent variable is $r$.
- **Dependent variable**: The symbol that represents a number in the $range$ of
  $f$. In the circle example the dependent variable is $A$.

## The Vertical Line Test

To test whether the equation is a function, meaning exactly one element of the
domain is assigned to exactly one element of the range, we have The Vertical
Line Test.

> A curve in the $xy$-plane is the graph of a function of $x$ if and only if no
> vertical line intersects the curve more than once.

## Properties of functions

### Piecewise defined functions

There are cases when a function have different formulas in different part of
their domain. These are the piecewise defined functions.

$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
x^2 & \text{if } x < 0 \\
0 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
x + 1 & \text{if } x > 0
\end{cases}
$$

### Even or odd functions

If function $f$ satisfies

$$
f(-x) = f(x)
$$

for every number in its domain, then
$f$ is an even function. It also means that the graph is symmetric to the
$y$-axis.

If function $f$ satisfies

$$
f(-x) = -f(x)
$$

for every number in its domain, then
$f$ is an odd function. It also means that the graph is about the origin.
