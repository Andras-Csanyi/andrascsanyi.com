\subsection{Explain the notation of Sets and Intervals!}

A \textbf{Set} is a collection of objects called \textbf{elements}.

Notation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $S$ is a set
    \item $a \in S$ means $a$ is element of $S$
    \item $b \notin S$ means $b$ is not element of $S$
    \item $S$ and $T$ are sets and their union is $S \cup T$ and consists all of
        elements that either member of $S$ or $T$ or both
    \item the intersection of $S \cap T$ means the elements part of both sets, in
        other words, this is the common part of both sets
    \item the empty set is denoted by $\emptyset$
\end{itemize}

The listing the elements notation of a set:

\begin{center}
$A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$
\end{center}

The builder notion of a set: 

\begin{center}
$ A = \{x | x \text{ is an integer and } 0 < x < 8 \}$
\end{center}
