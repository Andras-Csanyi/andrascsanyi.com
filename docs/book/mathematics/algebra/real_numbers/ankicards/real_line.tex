\subsection{What are the properties of the Real Line?}

The properties of the Real Line:

\begin{itemize}
    \item reference point is called origin, its value is $0$
    \item each positive $x$ number is represented on the right side
    \item each negative $-x$ number is represented on the left side
    \item the number assiciated with the point $P$ is called the coordinate of
        $P$
    \item the real numbers are ordered:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a$ is less than $b$,  $a < b$ if $b - a$ is a positive number,
            meaning $a$ lies on the left of $b$ on the number line
        \item $a$ is greater than $b$, $a > b$ when $a - b$ is a negative
            number, meaning $a$ lies on the right side of $b$ on the number line
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
